Σcho is a mod for Minecraft 1.10.2, that seeks to add ways for extending End-Game.  
To do this, it is designed with full MineTweaker support from the start.

Σcho is also designed to work alongside similar mods, like Avaritia, without doing the exact same things.

Σcho also seeks to add new blocks to continue End-Game in other mods, or fix issues.
